This is a design that will enable use of the RGB LED matrix sold by Adafruit
with an FPGA in order to achieve full-motion graphics across any number of
panels in a variety of configurations. It is written in VHDL and is currently a
work-in-progress.

Also included in this project is client software that is used to send data to
the circuit running on the FPGA. There are two parts to it. The first part is a
Processing library that provides an easy way to send images to the device. The
second part is a small Tcl server script that interfaces with a ByteBlaster
(through the Altera Tcl API) and provides a vendor-specific JTAG wrapper over
a TCP/IP socket.

What's included:
* contrib         Additional files not required for building the project
  * photos        Photographs of the design and hardware in use
  * tutorial      Tutorial on how to setup, build, and use the design
* de0-nano        Files specific to the DE0-Nano FPGA dev board
* processing      Client library with usage example
* tcl             Server script to interface with the virtual JTAG
* vhdl            VHDL source code for the design to use on the FPGA
  * megawizard    Altera Megafunction IP code for the virtual JTAG
  * testbenches   VHDL to use for simulation of selected entities

Features implemented:
* Read graphics data from RAM and display it on panel
* Support multiple panels
* Read video data from external device and fill into RAM
* User configurable pixel depth (brightness control)
