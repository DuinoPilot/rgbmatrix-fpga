This is a design that will enable use of the RGB LED matrix sold by Adafruit
with an FPGA in order to achieve full-motion graphics across any number of
panels in a variety of configurations. It is written in VHDL and is currently a
work-in-progress.

Features implemented so far:
* Read graphics data from RAM and display it on panel

Features to become implemented soon:
* Support multiple panels
* Better than 3 bits per pixel (any multiple of 3)
* Read video data from external device and fill into RAM
