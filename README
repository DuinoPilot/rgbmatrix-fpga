This is a design that will enable use of the RGB LED matrix sold by Adafruit
with an FPGA in order to achieve full-motion graphics across any number of
panels in a variety of configurations. It is written in VHDL and is currently a
work-in-progress.

Also included in this project is client software that is used to send data to
the circuit running on the FPGA. There are two parts to it. The first part is a
Windows program written in C# that provides a graphical user interface. The
second part is a small Tcl server script that interfaces with the Altera USB
ByteBlaster and provides a vendor-specific JTAG wrapper.

Features implemented so far:
* Read graphics data from RAM and display it on panel
* Support multiple panels
* Read video data from external device and fill into RAM

Features to become implemented soon:
* Better than 3 bits per pixel (any multiple of 3)
